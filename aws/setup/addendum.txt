## Some misconfiguration that was the last step to make the cluster working

Let's check the actual rules in both security groups to see what's allowed:

```bash
# Check EFS mount target security group rules
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
    --group-ids sg-0f01875297b08e89a \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --query 'SecurityGroups[0].{InboundRules:IpPermissions,OutboundRules:IpPermissionsEgress}'

# Check Ray cluster security group rules
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
    --group-ids sg-030176ebd4455dcc5 \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --query 'SecurityGroups[0].{InboundRules:IpPermissions,OutboundRules:IpPermissionsEgress}'
```

This will help us understand if:
1. The EFS security group allows inbound NFS traffic from your Ray cluster
2. The Ray cluster security group allows outbound traffic to the EFS mount target

Can you run these commands and share the output? Then we can determine what rules need to be added.

Thanks for the output. I notice:

1. The Ray cluster security group (`sg-030176ebd4455dcc5`) has:
   - Open outbound rules (`0.0.0.0/0`)
   - Port 2049 (NFS) is open inbound from `0.0.0.0/0`

2. We should modify the EFS mount target's security group (`sg-0f01875297b08e89a`) to allow NFS traffic specifically from the Ray cluster security group:

```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id sg-0f01875297b08e89a \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 2049 \
    --source-group sg-030176ebd4455dcc5 \
    --region us-west-2
```

Also, since we'll need the IAM permissions we discussed earlier, let's add those too:

```bash
# Create EFS access policy
cat > efs-policy.json << EOF
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "elasticfilesystem:ClientMount",
                "elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite",
                "elasticfilesystem:ClientRootAccess"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-west-2:892335585962:file-system/fs-08e6f8d79aaa5fd6e"
        }
    ]
}
EOF

# Create and attach the policy
aws iam create-policy \
    --policy-name EFSAccessPolicy \
    --policy-document file://efs-policy.json

aws iam attach-role-policy \
    --role-name ray-autoscaler-v1 \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::892335585962:policy/EFSAccessPolicy
```

Would you like me to help you apply these changes? After applying them, we should:
1. Verify the security group changes took effect
2. Test the EFS mount on a worker node again

Great, let's verify and test:

1. Verify security group changes:
```bash
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
    --group-ids sg-0f01875297b08e89a \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --query 'SecurityGroups[0].IpPermissions'
```

2. On a worker node, let's test the EFS mount:
```bash
# First unmount if it's currently mounted
sudo umount /shared

# Clear the current mount and verify
mount | grep shared
sudo rm -rf /shared/*  # Be careful with this command!
sudo mkdir -p /shared

# Try mounting with debug output
sudo mount -v -t efs -o tls fs-08e6f8d79aaa5fd6e:/ /shared

# Verify mount and test write permissions
mount | grep shared
touch /shared/test.txt
ls -la /shared
```

If there are any issues, let's check the logs:
```bash
# Check mount helper logs
sudo systemctl status amazon-efs-mount-watchdog.service
sudo journalctl -xe | grep -i "efs\|nfs"
```

Can you run these commands and share the output? Let's start with the security group verification and then proceed with the mount testing.
